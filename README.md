# Games-Terminal 🎮
Hello! **Welcome to Games-Terminal!** Before we start you might be wondering: *What Games-Terminal is?* 🤔

Well, *Games-Terminal* is a terminal that **allows you not only to use the default bash commands**, but also:
```
- Change between different themes (we will see it later)
- Use 3 brand new commands
```

## Requirements ❓
To **implement sucessfully this tool into your machine** you need to *execute the following commands*:
```
- sudo apt-get install python3.6 -> Installs Python interpreter on your machine
- sudo apt-get install python3-tk -> Installs Tkinter on your machine (Python uses it to create the terminal)
```

**If you did this steps sucessfully, congrats! You can now use Games-Terminal** 🥳
## Themes 🖼️
We have **cool themes to apply in your terminal!** Take a look at them! 😜

## Commands 👨‍💻
As we said before, **Games-Terminal supports every bash command, but also 3 new commands!** 😄
```
- theme (minecraft | valorant | shell) -> Updates terminal's theme
- date -> Gets actual date
- bash database.sh -> Integrates an entire database system into your terminal (you must be into the default script's directory)
```

**The entire terminal launches from a main script that allows you to see the PID of the main process (just in case you want to delete it)**
